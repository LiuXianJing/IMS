            Generative artificial intelligence AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) is an important symbol of the artificial intelligence 1.0 era entering the 2.0 era.
            </p>
            <p>
            The cumulative integration of GAN, CLIP, Transformer, Diffusion, pre-trained models, multi-modal technology, generation algorithms and other technologies has given rise to the explosion of AIGC. Continuous iterative innovations in algorithms, pre-trained models trigger qualitative changes in AIGC's technical capabilities, and multi-modality promotes AIGC content polygons, making AIGC more versatile and stronger in basic capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
            From the perspective of the advanced development of computational intelligence, perceptual intelligence and then cognitive intelligence, AIGC has opened the door to cognitive intelligence for human society. Through the learning and training of a single large-scale data, AI is equipped with knowledge in multiple different fields. It only needs to make appropriate adjustments and corrections to the model to complete tasks in real scenarios.

            <p>
            The significance of AIGC to human society and artificial intelligence is a milestone. In the short term, AIGC has changed the basic productivity tools. In the medium term, it will change the production relations of society. In the long term, it will promote a qualitative breakthrough in the productivity of the entire society. In such changes in productivity tools, production relations, and productivity, the factors of production—— The value of data is extremely amplified.
            </p>
            <p>
            AIGC elevates data elements to the core resource of the era, which to a certain extent accelerates the digital transformation process of the entire society.
